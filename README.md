# Get 'er Done

A to-do list/task management application with gamification elements, built using Ruby on Rails. Designed in collaboration with [Nemanja Drakulovic](https://github.com/DrDrakula) at Flatiron School, this was our final project for the Ruby/Rails module of the curriculum. This project uses bcrypt with browser cookies for user authentication and session persistence, and Bootstrap for quick and easy CSS styling.

The final product can be seen at <http://geterdone.kevinrandles.com>
